# Ludum Dare 52 - Harvest Clicker

*Unfortunately I did not have the opportunity to work on this more than a couple hours. The basic idea is there but I didn't get to the fun part: upgrades and automation.*

The theme of [Ludum Dare 52 game jam](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/52) is: **Harvest**

## Design

[The GDD tweet](https://twitter.com/TheJare/status/1611464063292411904): _I guess my next option is a clicker game._

Most other LD entries I've produced use some sort of power curve in lieu of level design or hand-designed player journey. So this thing fits like a glove.

## Build

Built with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) and [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/). Audio generated with [Chiptone](https://sfbgames.itch.io/chiptone).

- Install `node` + `npm`
- Run `node install`
- `npm run start` to watch & serve the project in debug mode
- `npm run build` to build a distributable version into the `dist/` folder

Much love to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-vscode) extension
